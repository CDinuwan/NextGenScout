However, from within the CAP, a super admin/admin user can send out the password reset email to a particular user. That is legal.\u00a0\n\nSo, we need to adjust the scope of this ticket so that a CAP super admin/admin user can send out a password reset email to a user from their user profile page. That way, the user is able to reset their password and XYZ doesn't know their password. FYI [~jlu2]\n\n!image-2019-06-21-10-46-23-744.png|width=760,height=280!;;;",

            "21/Jun/19 11:09 AM;abondar;[~rdannelly], [~dlederer], [~rtangri], [~smorozov]\nIt looks like we need to double check the scope and use case of \"Set Password\" functionality in Admin UI.\nThe functionality allows to set/reset the password for the user who is not able to do it by himself.\nReasons:\n~ user has lost access to his email account;\n~ user is not able to reset the password for some reason.\nIn such critical case, the \"super admin\" (!) is able to help the user and set the password to him.\nPlease note:\n~ that the customer will be notified by default;\n~ the admin is not able to see the user's password. Set new is the only option.\n\nSo I do not see any serious security risk from the password storage perspective.\nWe do not store the customer passwords in the open state and do not allow somebody to see the user's password. \nIt is just an extra functionality which could allow us to help our customers in some emergency cases.\nNote: the similar functionality is available to admins in all our previous solutions (WPE4) as well as in other solutions (Canvas LMS for instance).\n\nAs for simplified proposal: send a Reset Password email - it is already implemented.\nEverybody might access the https://learning-qa.XYZ.com/ngonboard/index.html#/ForgotPassword page and enter the required email address.\n\nCould you please double check the point and confirm the necessity to redesign the proposed solution?;;;",
            "21/Jun/19 11:19 AM;rtangri;[~abondar] I have to disagree with rationales given above. If user lost his email account they have bigger problem not just us setting his password.

While you are correct that we currently take the necessary steps to hide the password in the UI and in the DB, the fact that the XYZ tech support person helping the user knows the password (as they are keying it in) is the issue here. This opens up the question about data integrity (customer could claim that they had all their homework changed/removed by someone at XYZ since they knew my password). The fact that we do that in E4 and other system in XYZ does not make it a viable option.\u00a0\n\nIf the concern is that they really cannot do it by themselves and we need a mechanism to set a password for them, then the solution would have to be to use a temp password that would force them to reset their password when they login with that password we provide them. I am not sure if that helps if they have lost access to their email account.\n\nThanks.\n\nDavid;;;",

So if we have to must build this then way to implement this\n * Admins reset password\n * and in abc web properties we force then to reset the password when they login next time;;;",
            "21/Jun/19 12:13 PM;rdannelly;[~abondar], [~dlederer] and [~rtangri],\n\nTaking a step back to think of the main used case that we're solving for here...the main issue right now is that if/when a user calls tech support (or reaches out to their CSS) and says they can't get into their account, tech support/CSS can't actually assist them--they can just tell them to reset their password and tell them where to go and what to click to reset their password.\u00a0\n\nThis solution is to give our tech support team agency to actually help along the process of resetting a password. If a user starts a conversation with an agent and says they can't get into the platform, that agent just needs to be able to find that user in the Cinnamon Bread and push out the password reset email to that user's email address.\n\nThat will allow Tech Support to actionable support users while staying entirely out of the business of knowing what new password they set.\n\nI would vote against going to the route of adding in the extra step where XYZ sets the password and then the user resets the password. That adds another step in the process that doesn't need to be there.;;;",

Decline the functionality (close the ticket as \"won't do\").\n2. Decrease the priority and put the item to the backlog for future.\n3. Implement the simplified approach: replace the window with the link to the \"Forgot Password\" page.
