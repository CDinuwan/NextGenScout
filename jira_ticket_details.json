XYZ cannot support changing (and therefore knowing) users' passwords within our admin system. It's a legal issue. However, from within the CAP, a super admin/admin user can send out the password reset email to a particular user. That is legal.\u00a0\n\nSo, we need to adjust the scope of this ticket so that a CAP super admin/admin user can send out a password reset email to a user from their user profile page. That way, the user is able to reset their password and XYZ doesn't know their password. FYI [~jlu2]\n\n!image-2019-06-21-10-46-23-744.png|width=760,height=280!;;;",

Set new is the only option.\n\nSo I do not see any serious security risk from the password storage perspective.\nWe do not store the customer passwords in the open state and do not allow somebody to see the user's password. \nIt is just an extra functionality which could allow us to help our customers in some emergency cases.\nNote: the similar functionality is available to admins in all our previous solutions (WPE4) as well as in other solutions (Canvas LMS for instance).\n\nAs for simplified proposal: send a Reset Password email - it is already implemented.\nEverybody might access the https://learning-qa.XYZ.com/ngonboard/index.html#/ForgotPassword page and enter the required email address.\n\nCould you please double check the point and confirm the necessity to redesign the proposed solution?;;;",
            "21/Jun/19 11:19 AM;rtangri;[~abondar] I have to disagree with rationales given above. If user lost his email account they have bigger problem not just us setting his password.

            "21/Jun/19 11:25 AM;dlederer;Hi [~abondar]\n\nThanks for your comments. While you are correct that we currently take the necessary steps to hide the password in the UI and in the DB, the fact that the XYZ tech support person helping the user knows the password (as they are keying it in) is the issue here. This opens up the question about data integrity (customer could claim that they had all their homework changed/removed by someone at XYZ since they knew my password). The fact that we do that in E4 and other system in XYZ does not make it a viable option.\u00a0\n\nIf the concern is that they really cannot do it by themselves and we need a mechanism to set a password for them, then the solution would have to be to use a temp password that would force them to reset their password when they login with that password we provide them. I am not sure if that helps if they have lost access to their email account.\n\nThanks.\n\nDavid;;;",
            "21/Jun/19 11:39 AM;abondar;[~rtangri], [~dlederer]\nThank you for the feedback. I see your point but could not agree with your from \"system functionality\" perspective.\nWe will lose some scenarios in the case.\nHere are quick search examples of the same functionality in competitive systems:\n~ Blackboard: https://help.blackboard.com/Collaborate/Ultra/Administrator/Manage_Users#reset-passwords_OTP-4\n~ Canvas: https://alliedhealthcareertraining.com/knowledgebase\netc.\n\nRyann,\nCould you please comment on that?;;;",
            "21/Jun/19 11:59 AM;rtangri;[~abondar] That doesn't make them right I will prefer more secure system then have this functionality.\n\nThe system which support this will force user to change password after the reset by admins. So if we have to must build this then way to implement this\n * Admins reset password\n * and in abc web properties we force then to reset the password when they login next time;;;",
            "21/Jun/19 12:13 PM;rdannelly;[~abondar], [~dlederer] and [~rtangri],\n\nTaking a step back to think of the main used case that we're solving for here...the main issue right now is that if/when a user calls tech support (or reaches out to their CSS) and says they can't get into their account, tech support/CSS can't actually assist them--they can just tell them to reset their password and tell them where to go and what to click to reset their password.\u00a0\n\nThis solution is to give our tech support team agency to actually help along the process of resetting a password. If a user starts a conversation with an agent and says they can't get into the platform, that agent just needs to be able to find that user in the Cinnamon Bread and push out the password reset email to that user's email address.\n\nThat will allow Tech Support to actionable support users while staying entirely out of the business of knowing what new password they set.\n\nI would vote against going to the route of adding in the extra step where XYZ sets the password and then the user resets the password. That adds another step in the process that doesn't need to be there.;;;",

Decline the functionality (close the ticket as \"won't do\").\n2. Decrease the priority and put the item to the backlog for future.\n3. Implement the simplified approach: replace the window with the link to the \"Forgot Password\" page.

            "25/Mar/20 10:02 AM;dstepkin;the root cause of this issue is the following:\nin abc data model we have 2 user roles: STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR.\n\nwhen LMS user launches XYZ content request goes through our LTI layer. LTI layer is mapping all the roles (e.g. Teaching Assistant, Observer, Admin etc) into 2 roles we have. Teaching Assistant role mapping is INSTRUCTOR.\n\nIn order to claim LMS user with existing XYZ user, roles of LMS user and XYZ user should be the same, otherwise user will see claim account error (and this behavior is expected). So that is exactly what happening here. Most of the users listed above have XYZ account with STUDENT role (screenshot attached)\n\nthe only exception here is sdolphin@umich.edu who has 2 roles: both STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR. and based on records in another database table problem is most likely solved already. since i can see that there is a link between LMS user with INSTRUCTOR role and XYZ user with INSTRUCTOR role.;;;",
            "25/Mar/20 10:26 AM;dstepkin;potential solution (quick fix) might be to add INSTRUCTOR role to all the XYZ users with STUDENT role listed above and then try to proceed with claim account flow.\n\nThis could be done in several different ways:\n* Create a course for this user via Course Setup Tool (it will automatically add INSTRUCTOR role to existing user)\n* Enroll existing student as instructor into XYZ course section (it could be done both in Cinnamon Bread and Instructor Admin Tool)\n* add that role directly by calling appropriate abc API with correct payload\n\nMost likely Cinnamon Bread is a way to go here since it is the safest options from these listed above. But in any case Department have to be selected in order to create PROFESSOR record in CORE system.\n\nBut worth mentioning that this approach has some side effects. And that dual-role users were considered as an edge case and we didn't pay that much attention to it during our development / testing process. Basic flows were tested but it was overall it was not tested as rigorously as regular single-role students or instructors.\n\nBut it is kind of *a gray area* in terms of *potential side effects*.\n\nIf you need any development in this area - [~rdannelly] is a proper person to contact.\n\nfyi [~chrcollier] [~sflanigan] [~lfavors] [~abondar] [~osolovyo];;;",

Most students enter a specific course code provided by their instructor, which takes them directly to their section, but many students do not know the code. These students need to browse the course finder to locate their section.\n\nStudents can browse by course name, instructor name, or see all sections at the school. The lists should only show active sections that are still open for registration; sections no longer open for registration should not be available in the course finder.\u00a0\nh1. Approach\n * Each NG course section object should include a new binary attribute to signal discoverability to the NG course finder; see NG-4962.\n\nh1. Acceptance Criteria\n * A NG Admin can easily modify the discoverability attribute for one or many sections.\n * Discoverable course sections display in the NG course finder and are available for registration, BAU.\n * Non-discoverable course sections are hidden in the NG course finder and not available for students to register.\n\nh1. Out of scope\n * Filtering non-discoverable sections in the course code search UI.\n * Add discoverability toggle to the CAP.\n * Add discoverability toggle to the IAT.\n * Automated triggers to modify section discoverability:\n ** discoverable if\u00a0published, active\n ** non-discoverable if\u00a0unpublished, concluded or section end date in the past",

Best approach would then be to fix the XYZ cookie header bloat by changing how XYZ Azure integration handles checking groups (i.e. instead of storing all memberships in the cookie/JWT, would need API to check against).\u00a0;;;",

            "30/Nov/21 2:57 PM;atyukavkin;[~rharman] I can answer only some questions: \n- _why the unpair may happened?_ Most likely it was done manually via Cinnamon Bread. At least, I can see in the logs 'unpair' request however I can not say was it for this course or not. Unfortunately, we do not have audit trail and we do not know who unpaired the course. We do not have automatic unpairing, so the trigger is always manual.\n- _double pairing._ It was not expected that the course could be paired twice. In normal scenario a course should be paired only once. We plan to improve the logic and avoid duplication records even if the course paired twice. ;;;",

I think that kind of approach is far more preferable than a word + unique string, such as 'Anonymous54321'. If this is a possibility for consideration, we could come up with some other combination of random words unique to XYZ and the context of education, such as 'adjective + element from the periodic table', like 'Fluffy Carbon' or 'Pulchritudinous Fluoride' or similar.

        "Description": "Task prerequisite as per [~ewinklem]:\n{quote}Because we've had feedback that naming all the sub-sub-accounts under each institution in the Automatically-Provisioned Courses account as \"Adoptions\" or \"Test Drives\" is not helpful when you're viewing lists of course sub-sub-accounts (because you can't tell them apart), we'd like to test whether there would be any adverse affect on renaming the sub-sub-accounts to include their institution's names (e.g., change DAYTONA BEACH COLLEGE 's \"Test Drive\" sub-sub-account to \"DAYTONA BEACH COLLEGE Test Drives\").\n\nWe began doing that manually in production (after asking Alexander B and his team to verify that there would be no negative impact), and changed the names of about 2 dozen institution's' sub-sub-accounts, but given the issue we're seeing with ORION grades not following through when a course is moved to a different sub-account, we now feel it's better to thoroughly test this is a lower environment before we go any further.\n\nAlso, we think we should un-edit the 2 dozen or so sub-sub-account names in Production, but perhaps even having edited them at all will cause a problem, so we'll hold off on that until we have more information.\n{quote}\n*Successful criteria:*\n # The operational request shall be tested in lower environment (stage or QA).\n # Simulate the production set up to prepare a couple of institutions and courses for testing considering the new and existing sub-sub-accounts which could include students participated assignments and grades.\n # After the renaming according to Edward Winkleman's suggestion, the instructors and students shall be able to access the contents without any issue, except the known production issue\u00a0https://jira.XYZ.com/browse/NGPROD-225.\n # The renaming shall consider the institution names could include special characters as below.

An inability to create new accounts with Chinese characters was addressed in NGPROD-3080, after which the problem was resolved.\n\nIn fact, I had created an account to test the resolution of NGPROD-3080 and it is still operational; I also created a 2nd account since this latest report to test account creation and login with a name containing Chinese characters and it, too, works for login:\n\ntcs.XYZ+test@gmail.com / \ntcs.XYZ+test@gmail.com / paassword\n\nYet, here is an unaltered example (at the time of creating this JIRA ticket) of a student account that cannot login.\n\nf74112271@gs.ncku.edu.tw / zXc12300\n\nOther students are able to login after the Asia team removed the Chinese characters:\n\n||Original First Name||Username||Password||New First Name||\n|\u9673\u5274\u5d34|f54101048@gs.ncku.edu.tw|GAY945haha|F54101048|\n|\u8607\u82b3\u541b|f54104054@gs.ncku.edu.tw|Aa92010890845|F54104054|\n|\u5433\u627f\u8afa|f54101072@gs.ncku.edu.tw|blacksmith1011|F54101072|\n\nA secondary issue that has been detected is in trying to use CAP to set a student name back to using the Chinese characters for further testing.

The quick fix seems to be to update the name in CAP, after which the student is able to login. In that sense, there is a workaround, but having to employ this workaround is contrary to what we thought was solved for with NGPROD-3080, allowing students to create and use their accounts with Chinese characters.\n\nIf this is eventually resolved, it further seems we are unable to use CAP to restore the characters that are remove, due to rules in place with CAP that are apparently different than those employed during account creation.\n\nFor the record, WPE4 could also tolerate Chinese characters from the XYZPLUS perspective, but just as with abc, these characters are replaced with '?' in CORE.;;;",

Current implementation do not expect extra symbols (decodes a Base64-encoded string (\"atob\" should be read as \"ASCII to binary\")) To support this we need additional implementation.\n\n!image-2022-11-23-11-13-08-123.png|width=616,height=130!\n\n[~tellin]\u00a0\nhttps://jira.XYZ.com/browse/NG-16572 We were not notified about this ticket and it seems that it is not completed, because if the validation of one entity changes, then this should be distributed throughout the system (FE/BE busness logic including IAT, Course Builder, Cinnamon Bread, Onboarding applications) Also as Alexander Bondar and Tim Summers mentioned new rules cause issues with a corrupted data on the Core side.;;;",
            "23/Nov/22 8:32 AM;tsummers;Jess Ho (Digital Delivery Coordinator) in Singapore created a new test account with Chinese characters that, as with my test accounts with Chinese characters, has no problem. The issue, therefore, seems to be present only for older accounts - perhaps those earlier than a specific date for creation?\n\nJolyn Ng (Senior Manager, Digital Delivery) would appreciate a speedy resolution to the problem. Given the inconvenience and disruption these issues have caused, our Taiwan customers are reconsidering using XYZPLUS.\n\nSince GA for abc (and earlier, in WPE4), the use of Chinese characters was not a problem until the issue reported in NGPROD-3080. After that was addressed, and for the more recently created accounts, it is still not a problem (yet). These accounts may have appeared less than desirable or easy to read in CORE, but the important thing was that the system worked, despite appearances in CORE.;;;",
